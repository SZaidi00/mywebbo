        <h3> New Project coming soon!</h3>
          <body>
            Once it is further a long and theres more to discuss I will reveal it! The idea is there but it will
            take quite some time to work. Hopefully February 1,2022 is when this website will be updated again 
            with more information on the project. Stay tuned!

      <h3>The Website you see now</h3>
        <body>
        So this was my first major project I've done. I didn't really have any experience with HTML,CSS, or JavaScript
        before hand so it was all pretty new to me. It was definitely fun seeing what I could make and learning about the 
        different features. Though, I don't think I really need a lot of them for this website like letting people add stuff
        and deleting things they may need or having different click events. I thought about maybe having people submit 
        recipes they liked so everyone could see but I am kind of more excited to start my next project which will be pretty
        time consuming. Once its started and a little bit further along the way then I'll update the website to reveal it.

        <h3>Sudkou</h3>
          <body>
          So this project is currently in progress that I've put on the side for the website and the upcoming project. 
          But also I started reading the Data Structures & Algorithms textbook to get a better foundation so that's why
          this project was also put on hold. Currently the goal is to create a sudoku board that is already solved and then 
          reveal only certain numbers for the user to try and solve it. I want to create different difficulties, just reveal 
          less numbers when I get to that point. It is definitely heavy logic based to ensure no numbers are in the same
          column or row as well as the same 3x3 square. Currently I have 2D array to set the board up, but when I revisit it 
          I think I might try to see if any other data structure will work better. It's a good challenge and I want to get back to it. Hopefully soon!

        <h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
        <body>
          This one isn't too crazy. I think I need to fine tune it a little for it to be perfect but it does work. 
          This was to get back into the groove of things when I first restarted programming after some time.
